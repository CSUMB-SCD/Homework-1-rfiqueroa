# Project Title

## What was this project about? 
    This project aims to create a simple web app that will allow me to
    exercise some of my newly discovered Software Engineering skills.
    
## What was the learning objectives?
    Combine technologies of git, Github, and Heroku. Through
    this simple web app, I hope to help others help create web apps
    using similar technologies.
    
## What are known problems, if any, with this assignment?
    Git and Github have been difficult to work with at times.
    For previous projects, I have had to use two-factor authentication
    and this has been the source of problems when I have needed
    to work on new projects. Integrating git and Github with 
    software engineering projects is an incredibly important skill,
    but it can also cause many problems like when I had trouble
    connecting to my Github repo.
    
## How would you improve it if you had more time?
    I would like to have had more time to work with git and Github
    and discuss some possible troubleshooting lessons. It is too
    easy to spend hours fixing problems due to git.
